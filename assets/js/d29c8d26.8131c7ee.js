The term "flattened" is an industry term used to describe an image file that has it\'s header information removed. Header information is used by graphic design software packages such as Photoshop or Illustrator so they can keep track of file edits. This allows the files to be editable after saving and re-opening. Flattened images are much smaller in file size but are no longer editable. Most graphic designers keep two copies of each file, one flattened (for use online and in mobile apps) and one un-flattened so they can go back later and update the image.
